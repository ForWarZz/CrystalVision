# CrystalVision
Crystal Vision is an IA able to predict the result of a LOL game, from and only from the draft time.

## About the project
I am an IA beginner. This is my first project about AI, neural network, using Python, with TensorFlow.\
**_All the data used to train the model was scraped using the official RIOT API (~80 000 games...)_**

## Contribution
If you reach to have better result or if you have improvements to give. \ _You can pull your changes because this interests me a lot._

## TODO
- Finish software to use the model (league of legends local api ?)
- Optimization + better code
- Data analytics to train better the IA's model
- Update dependencies (TensorFlow...)

## Contact
You can easly contact me on **Discord**, if you got question or improvement... \
